## SEO fixes summary (confirmed) – 2025-09-26

This is a focused implementation plan based on recent Search Console patterns and the site’s current code/config.

- Homepage: CTR is underperforming. Improve meta title and description; add Organization/Website (and optionally LocalBusiness) structured data.
- Italian Kitchen Cabinets: Very high impressions, very low clicks. Strengthen meta; add FAQ schema.
- Products Collection: Similar situation; strengthen meta. Canonical already non-slash and trailing-slash redirect added.
- Internal links: Add keyword-rich anchors from Homepage to Sustainability and Collaboration.
- Noindex housekeeping: Keep /admin out of index; /footer already noindexed; Terms is legitimate and in sitemap (keep indexed), Crafted Calm optional.
- Geo-targeting: Add a short city-focused section to your money pages (NYC, NJ, Florida). 

Sitemap and canonical checks
- `public/sitemap.xml` lists the canonical non-slash `https://dnddesigncenter.com/productscollection`.
- `src/pages/ProductsCollection.tsx` canonical is non-slash and JSON-LD includes FAQ via `accordionFeatureSeoMetadata`.
- `src/pages/ItalianKitchenCabinets.tsx` is indexable and has solid OG/Twitter tags; missing FAQ JSON-LD.
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` canonical is the root and currently includes a VideoObject JSON-LD only.
- Netlify: `trailingSlash = "never"` set; explicit `/productscollection/ -> /productscollection` redirect was added to `public/_redirects`.
- Headers: `public/_headers` already noindexes `/footer`; add `/admin` (and optionally `/crafted-calm`).

## 1) Homepage – meta + structured data

Recommended Helmet changes for `src/pages/Home.tsx`:

Title and description

```tsx
<Helmet>
  <title>Italian Luxury Kitchens & Interiors – NYC, NJ & Florida | D&D Design Center</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="Bespoke Italian kitchens, closets, baths & interiors. Brooklyn showroom. Free 30-min consult. Serving NYC, New Jersey, Miami & Palm Beach."
  />
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://dnddesigncenter.com/" />
</Helmet>
```

Organization + Website JSON-LD (optionally add LocalBusiness; see note):

```tsx
<script type="application/ld+json">
  {JSON.stringify({
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@graph": [
      {
        "@type": "Organization",
        "@id": "https://dnddesigncenter.com#org",
        "name": "D&D Design Center",
        "url": "https://dnddesigncenter.com/",
        "logo": {
          "@type": "ImageObject",
          "url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/designcenter/image/upload/v1741965462/DnD_Logo_Transparent.svg"
        },
        "sameAs": [
          "https://www.facebook.com/dnddesigncenter",
          "https://www.instagram.com/dnddesigncenter.nyc"
        ]
      },
      {
        "@type": "WebSite",
        "@id": "https://dnddesigncenter.com#website",
        "url": "https://dnddesigncenter.com/",
        "name": "D&D Design Center",
        "publisher": { "@id": "https://dnddesigncenter.com#org" },
        "inLanguage": "en-US"
      }
    ]
  })}
</script>
```

Optional: LocalBusiness. You already define LocalBusiness on product/service pages. You can duplicate it on Home safely; if you prefer to centralize it, move that block here and remove elsewhere.

```tsx
{
  /* Optional addition to the @graph above */
  {
    "@type": "LocalBusiness",
    "@id": "https://dnddesigncenter.com#business",
    "name": "D&D Design Center",
    "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/designcenter/image/upload/DnD_Logo_Transparent.svg",
    "telephone": "+1 718-934-7100",
    "priceRange": "$$$",
    "address": {
      "@type": "PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "2615 East 17th Street",
      "addressLocality": "Brooklyn",
      "addressRegion": "NY",
      "postalCode": "11235",
      "addressCountry": "US"
    },
    "geo": { "@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": 40.586662, "longitude": -73.953265 }
  }
}
```

---

## 2) Italian Kitchen Cabinets – meta + FAQ schema

File: `src/pages/ItalianKitchenCabinets.tsx`

Meta title + description (replace the current ones inside `<Helmet>`):

```tsx
<title>Italian Kitchen Cabinets NYC – Luxury Designs, 3D in 7 Days | D&D</title>
<meta
  name="description"
  content="Handcrafted in Italy. Installed in NY in ~8 weeks. See 20+ finishes in our Brooklyn showroom. Free 30‑min consult and a 3D plan in 7 days."
/>
```

Add FAQ JSON-LD (place inside the same Helmet block):

```tsx
<script type="application/ld+json">
  {JSON.stringify({
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "FAQPage",
    "mainEntity": [
      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "How much do Italian kitchen cabinets cost in NYC?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Most projects range from $15k–$50k depending on size, finishes, and accessories. We provide a transparent line‑item quote after your design consult."
        }
      },
      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "How fast can you design and install?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "3D design in ~7 days. Typical installation ~8 weeks after approvals, depending on scope and supplier lead times."
        }
      },
      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Do you offer free consultations?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes. Book a complimentary 30‑minute showroom consultation to review finishes, layouts, and budget ranges."
        }
      }
    ]
  })}
  </script>
```

---

## 3) Products Collection – meta refresh

File: `src/pages/ProductsCollection.tsx`

Helmet recommendations (update only the two lines below):

```tsx
<title>Luxury Custom Kitchens & Furniture – NYC Showroom | D&D</title>
<meta
  name="description"
  content="Explore our curated Italian collection: kitchens, closets, lighting & more. Brooklyn showroom. Complimentary design consultation available."
/>
```

Notes
- Canonical is already `https://dnddesigncenter.com/productscollection` (correct) and sitemap matches.
- FAQ JSON-LD is present via `accordionFeatureSeoMetadata` (keep).
- We added a hard redirect to squash the trailing-slash variant (see below).

---

## 4) Internal linking boosts (Homepage snippets)

Add a small section on the Homepage to strengthen topical links to Sustainability and Collaboration using descriptive anchors.

```tsx
{/* Place this after <SustainabilitySection /> or near a CTA block */}
<section className="mx-auto max-w-5xl px-6 py-8">
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Design with Purpose</h3>
  <p className="text-gray-700">
    We build <a className="text-amber-700 underline" href="/sustainability">sustainable luxury kitchens</a>
    and interiors with materials that last. See how our
    {' '}<a className="text-amber-700 underline" href="/collaboration">Italian brand collaborations</a>
    bring craftsmanship to every space.
  </p>
  <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700">
    Explore our <a className="text-amber-700 underline" href="/productscollection">hand‑made product collection</a>
    for kitchens, closets, lighting and more.
  </p>
  {/* Optionally add a small list of deep links */}
  {/* <ul className="mt-4 list-disc ml-5 text-gray-700">
    <li><a className="text-amber-700 underline" href="/italian-kitchen-cabinets">Italian kitchen cabinets in NYC</a></li>
    <li><a className="text-amber-700 underline" href="/designers">Meet our designers</a></li>
  </ul> */}
  
</section>
```

---

## 5) Noindex housekeeping (Headers)

File: `public/_headers`

Already present:

```text
/footer
  X-Robots-Tag: noindex
```

Recommended additions:

```text
/admin
  X-Robots-Tag: noindex

# Optional: only if you decide this page shouldn’t rank
/crafted-calm
  X-Robots-Tag: noindex
```

Note: `Terms` and `Privacy` are legitimate, appear in the sitemap, and generally should remain indexable.

---

## 6) Geo-targeting snippet (money pages)

Add a small geo-focused paragraph block to money pages (e.g., Italian Kitchen Cabinets, Products Collection). This can sit above the CTA.

```tsx
<section className="mx-auto max-w-5xl px-6 py-10">
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Italian Kitchens in NYC, New Jersey & Florida</h3>
  <p className="text-gray-700">
    From brownstones in Brooklyn to homes across New Jersey and South Florida, we tailor Italian cabinetry to fit your space and lifestyle.
    Visit our Brooklyn showroom or book a virtual consult. We regularly serve NYC, Hoboken/Jersey City, Miami & Palm Beach.
  </p>
</section>
```

If you plan to build city pages later, convert the cities above into internal links.

---

## 7) Redirect to consolidate trailing-slash

File: `public/_redirects` (already added)

```text
/productscollection/  /productscollection   301!
```

This ensures analytics and Search Console consolidate metrics to the non-slash canonical.

---

## 8) Copy-ready meta rewrites (quick paste)

  - Title: Italian Luxury Kitchens – NYC, NJ & Florida | D&D Design Center
  - Description: Bespoke Italian kitchens and interiors. Brooklyn showroom. Free 30‑min consult. Serving NYC, New Jersey, Miami & Palm Beach. Book your design session today.
